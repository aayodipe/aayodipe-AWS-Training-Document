# How to Troubleshoot Python code
    # When a program contains a significant error, Python displays a traceback, which is an error report. Python looks through the file and tries to identify the problem. Check the traceback; it might give you a clue as to what issue is preventing the program from running.

# Step away from your computer, take a short break, and then try again. Remember that syntax is very important in programming, so even a missing colon, a mismatched quotation mark, or mismatched parentheses can prevent a program from running properly. 

# Start over again. You probably donâ€™t need to uninstall any software, but it might make sense to delete your file-name.py file and re-create it from scratch

# Ask your pair/someone else review your code, and watch what they do carefully. You might have missed one small step that someone else happens to catch.

# Google-fu is your friend

# Variables and Simple Data type
# ================================
# 1. String (can use either single or double quote)
    # title (title())
    # upercase (upper())
    # lowercase (lower())
    # format (using variable in string )
    # stripping whitespace(lstrip,rstrip, strip)
# 2. Number
#       operators(+,-,/,*,**,//,%,=,==)
# 3. Floats
# 4. bool  (true or false)
# 5. List  (square bracket indicate list)
    # accessing items in list
    # Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements
    # stating with an empty list the add items to the list
    # using individual item in a list


num = [1,2,4]
num.insert(2, 3)
print(num)


# VARIABLE RULES

    # Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.

    # Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works, but greeting message will cause errors.

    # Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word print. 

    # Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.

    # Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
