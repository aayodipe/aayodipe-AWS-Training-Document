# Event Bridge
===============

# Amazon EventBridge
    is a serverless event bus service that you can use to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from your applications, software as a service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services to targets such as AWS Lambda functions, HTTP invocation endpoints using API destinations, or event buses in other AWS accounts. 

# Amazon EventBridge events
    An event indicates a change in an environment such as an AWS environment, a SaaS partner service or application, or one of your applications or services. The following are examples of events:
        

    - Amazon EC2 generates an event when the state of an instance changes from pending to running.

    - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling generates events when it launches or terminates instances.

    - AWS CloudTrail publishes events when you make API calls.
