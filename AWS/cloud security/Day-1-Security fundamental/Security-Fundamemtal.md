### Security Fundamental

1. The Security Mandate- CIA Triad
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Availability
2. Assume Breach
3. Attack, Threat, *Risk* and Vulnerability
    Attack - an unauthorized attempt to access a computer system or IT resources to either modify, steal or infiltrate data
    Threat - Exploit a vulnerability
    Vulnerability- Weakness in an hardware, software or procedure
    Risk - A potential for lost or damaged or destroyed Asset

4. Defense In Depth
5. Least Privilege
6. Supply Chain Security
7. Attack Surface Reduction or Reduce blast radius
8. Hard Coding
9. Never Trust, Always Verify
10. Back-up and Roll Back
11. Encryption at Rest and In-Transit (Symmetry and Asymmetric Encryption)
    hashing and encryption
12. Push Left
13. Never Trust System Input- 
14. Client Side and server side validation
15. Logging and Monitoring
16. Code Review
17. Source Code
18. Infrastructure as code(IaC)
19. Always use production-like data during testing
20. SDLC    - Software development life cycle
        - Requirement - Security User stories, Security Evaluation, approval of proposed tech stack
        - Design - Treat-Modeling, Whiteboard Design to look for security flaw and architecture review
        - Coding - linters, secure coding, using known secure template, framework and libraries
        - Testing - conduct testing such as unit, SAST, DAST testing, scanning for secret embedded in code
        - Deployment/Release/Maintenance - Monitoring, Logging, security alert, and training
            - SAST - Static application security testing    
            - DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing
