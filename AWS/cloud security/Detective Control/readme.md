### DETECTIVE CONTROL
========================
Question to the class, How do you discover if something goes wrong in your environment in your absent?

In order to detect compromise in your AWS Account, you need to see every resources in your AWS Account as OBSERVABLE OBJECT. These observable objects and the information they manage, process, analyze, transmit or archive are the goal of your protection.

To protect the resources in your AWS Account using detective control means, you need to gather information about the status of the resources and most importantly the events or how the resources state are changing.

### AWS Detective control flow(DCF)
==============================
Let's look at the AWS Detective control flow. The DCF have hour part. 
a. The Resources State
b. Event Collection
c. Event Analysis
d. Action

# The Resources State
The DCF starts with keeping track of the configuration and the status over time of the collection of resources in your AWS Account. The collections of the resources(resources state) are the object under observations. They can be AWS resources such as EC2 Instances, S3 Buckets and objects, Amazon RDS , Amazon API Gateway etc or external or third party resources. 

# Event Collection
The Resources state change overtime as a result of business use or change in the environment or period of time. These changes or action represent an event. As event can occur at any point in time, day, night  or weekend, they need to be gathered or collected and this is called Event record or observable record.The Event collection is the registering or collecting or gathering of the events that occur as a result of the change in the 

# Event Analysis
Event gathered  or collected from the change in the resource state are raw, cumbersome and in large amount thus challenging to read or use. Thus, the raw data should be analysis to provide valuable  or value-added information. These analysis can be done in various ways such as compare the event with best practice, or baseline and inform you if there is a different between current state or desire state. You can also use statistic to determine if the event is normal or not.

### Action 
Analyzing the event collected from changes in resources that not complete if there is no response to the observable record or action to remediate the security issue or changes that was detected. Thus, the final state of the detective control is action taken. 

AWS provide multiple service or resources for every state of the detective control. In the next few hours we are going to be looking at some of these tools for each stage.

### THE RESOURCES STATE TOOLS
The first state, resources state, focus on knowing the state of the monitored resources. AWS Config and AWS System Manager, are two of the AWS Tools that helps to monitored the changes in the state of the observable object.

## AWS Config
Every AWS resources in your account have their configuration(enable, disable or customer configuration) at each point in time. AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account.

### AWS CloudTrail
 All action on AWS is an API Call. The API Calls. AWS CloudTrail is one of the services that keep record of these calls. CloudTrail also keep records of Non-API events that relate to service actions and sign-in attempt to the AWS Console.

 The activities that is recorded in the cloudtrail is called an event. There are three type of events:
 ## a. Management Event:
    Logs of Operation perform on an AWS Resources such as Create Bucket, delete bucket, create user, create group and Non API event like Log-in and Attempt Log-In.

 ## b. Data Event: 
    Logs of Operation perform within an AWS Resources such as Uploading an Image in S# Bucket(PutObject), Delete an Image from a Bucket(deleteObject) or GetObject which is view an image or list image from a bucket.
 ## c. Insight: 
        Meta-data events generated by CloudTrail when it detect an unusual or anomalies activities
