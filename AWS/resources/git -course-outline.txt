Introduction to version control
==================================
** Your daily task is to create things, save things, modified things, save things again and redo the process again and again, This is where version control works.
So version control is the system that manages the changes that you made in your code. Everytime that you make a changes in your code, the VC records the changes. 

case Study: If you are working on a project, you create the version 1, then the version 2 and then the version 3. Before the third version, your code was working correctly but after you added more code and save that as version 3 the feature stopped working, then you have 2 options. 1. Manually remove code that you added for the version 3 or you roll back to version 2.
